h2 The FDA reports that #{ratio}% of individuals who reported adverse effects from  #{drugname} were rendered deceased, hospitalized, or majorly disabled.

h3 Statistics have been obtained from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS).  This database includes publically released records between 2004-2013.

h6 Disclaimer. FAERS data does have limitations. There is no certainty that the reported event (adverse event or medication error) was actually due to the product. FDA does not require that a causal relationship between a product and event be proven, and reports do not always contain enough detail to properly evaluate an event.  Further, FDA does not receive reports for every adverse event or medication error that occurs with a product. Many factors can influence whether or not an event will be reported, such as the time a product has been marketed and publicity about an event.  Submission of a safety report does not constitute an admission that medical personnel, user facility, importer, distributor, manufacturer or product caused or contributed to the event. The information in these reports has not been scientifically or otherwise verified as to a cause and effect relationship and cannot be used to estimate the incidence of these events.
